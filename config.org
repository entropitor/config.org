#+title: Org-mode configuration

This is my emacs config as a literate org-mode file.

Load it with =(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/path/to/config.org")= in =init.el=

Thanks to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4&t=1236s][Harry Schwartz for the inspiration]].

* Org-mode

Log when tasks are done

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (setq org-log-done t)
#+END_SRC

* Babel

Support a few languages

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((ruby . t)
     (python . t)))
#+END_SRC

Auto-confirm evals

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+END_SRC

* Set the theme

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables
   ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   '(custom-enabled-themes (quote (wombat))))
  (custom-set-faces
   ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   )
#+END_SRC

* Lean

Initialize packages. This is not specific to lean and should probably move.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (package-initialize) ; You might already have this line
  (global-set-key (kbd "S-SPC") #'company-complete)
#+END_SRC

* Windmove

Use the default keybindings (S-<arrow>)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (windmove-default-keybindings)
#+END_SRC

Make windmove work in Org mode

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-shiftup-final-hook 'windmove-up)
  (add-hook 'org-shiftleft-final-hook 'windmove-left)
  (add-hook 'org-shiftdown-final-hook 'windmove-down)
  (add-hook 'org-shiftright-final-hook 'windmove-right)
#+END_SRC
